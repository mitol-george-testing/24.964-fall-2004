description: 'The goal of this assignment is to get familiar with some Perl syntax,
  while creating a program that does

  something like phonology. The task is to write a script that converts Italian orthography
  into phonemic transcription. It should take an input ?le, read it, and perform whatever
  substitutions are necessary to produce a ?rst approximation of a (broad) phonemic
  transcription.'
