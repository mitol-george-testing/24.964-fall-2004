description: 'The Jusczyk, Luce, and Charles ?Luce study employed sets of monosyllables
  which were claimed to have high and low phonotactic probabilities in English. The
  task is to check their claim, by computing the

  phonotactic probability of their test items. There is a ?le called CelexWordsInTranscription.txt,
  which

  contains a list of English words. The task is to write a program that reads in this
  file, computes the probabilities of their items, by the criteria used in that study.(That
  is, by the "positional" probabilities).'
